## Abstract

Virtual Reality is no distant dream anymore, but the technology has a 
marketing problem: A view through the eyes of a head-mounted display wearer 
is bland and loses the usage context. Following the first-person view is hard 
and it shows twitchy, unnatural motion.

This thesis discusses a general rendering pipeline for runtime 3D engines for 
Mixed Reality Media, a form of video composition that places a real person 
inside a virtual reality scene. The real world video will be augmented by 
multiple video techniques and parameters from the virtual environment.  
This allows for example the recreation of light conditions from the virtual 
scenery and creates an immersive and inviting view into the virtual scenery.
