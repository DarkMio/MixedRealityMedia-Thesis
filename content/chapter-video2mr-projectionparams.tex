\section{Virtual projection parameters from real world camera}
\label{sec:projection-params}
To produce a virtual projection there are four unknowns to solve for:

\begin{my_list}
	\item Position of the real world camera
	\item Rotation of the real world camera
	\item Field of View (FoV) of the camera
	\item Distance between the HMD and the real world camera
\end{my_list}

Luckily the former two are solved by the tracking solution, thus can be used 
directly as transformation matrix for the virtual camera - ignoring an 
additional offset from the actual controller to the camera, which is accounted 
for inside the software.
\newline
The calculation of a corresponding distance between a camera and the Vive HMD 
to control the virtual projection parameters can be solved, too: Since both 
devices are tracked, one natively and the other with a controller as 
tracking anchor, it can be calculated with the same euclidean distance as 
discussed earlier, with $C$ as camera position and $H$ as HMD position:

\eq{eq:zsort:distance}{
	Z = \sqrt{(C_X + H_X)^2 + (C_Y + H_Y)^2 + (C_Z + H_Z)^2}
}

	\label{fig:projection:distance}
\end{figure}

Another important projection parameter is field of view. Most production 
cameras only declare a focal length on lenses - which makes sense in that 
context, since field of view is a constraint between sensor size and focal 
length. Through the specification sheet of the camera the current field of view 
can be calculated inside Unity, with the sensor height as $S_h = 17.3mm$ and 
focal length as $F_l = 14mm$:

\eq{eq:zsort:fov}{
	FoV = 2*tan^{-1}\frac{S_h}{2 * F_l}
}

\eq{eq:zsort:fov:result}{
	FoV = 63.42028^\circ
}

With that we have now all projection parameters for the virtual environment to 
generate an image that matches in relative transformation parameters as the 
real world camera would look at.
