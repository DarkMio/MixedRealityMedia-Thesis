\section{Order of Calculation}

The order of discussed topics is written in order of how impactful this 
operation is on image quality, in reality an optimized pipeline is changed 
slightly. For example, post processing the video feed has to be done before it 
is composited into the mixed reality image. This flowchart 
(\ref{fig:steps:order:alt}) demonstrates the actual calculation sequence. Also 
shown is a separation between engine scripting and shader programming.
