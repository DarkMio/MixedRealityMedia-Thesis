and exploring itself.}{Alan W. Watts}{(Philosopher)}

The well known urban legend of "L'Arriv\'ee d'un train en gare de La Ciotat" in 
which a train arrives at the La Ciotat station, is, that "the audience was so 
overwhelmed by the moving image [...] coming directly at them that people 
screamed and ran to the back of the room". \cite{wiki:train:2017} With that a 
new medium was created, which matured into a new art form of film and movies.
