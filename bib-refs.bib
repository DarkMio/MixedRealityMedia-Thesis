	abstract = {An apparatus is described which facilitates the presentation of 
	pairs of variable colors without variation of luminance. With this 
	instrument, various criteria of visual sensitivity to color difference have 
	been investigated. The standard deviation of color matching was finally 
	adopted as the most reproducible criterion. The test field was two degrees 
	in diameter, divided by a vertical biprism edge, and was viewed centrally 
	with a surrounding field of forty-two degrees diameter uniformly 
	illuminated so as to have a chromaticity similar to that of the I.C.I. 
	Standard Illuminant C (average daylight). The luminance of the test field 
	was maintained constant at 15 millilamberts, and the surrounding field was 
	7.5 millilamberts. These fields were viewed monocularly through an 
	artificial pupil, 2.6 mm in diameter. Over twenty-five thousand trials at 
	color matching have been recorded for a single observer, and the readings 
	are analyzed in detail and compared with previously available data. The 
	standard deviations of the trials are represented in terms of distance in 
	the standard 1931 I.C.I. chromaticity diagram. These increments of distance 
	are represented as functions of position alongstraight lines in the 
	chromaticity diagram, and also as functions of direction of departure from 
	points representing certain standard chromaticities. Such representations 
	are simpler than the traditional representations of wave-length thresholds 
	and purity thresholds as functions of wave-length, and the accuracy of the 
	representations is improved by this simplicity. Chromaticity discrimination 
	for non-spectral colors is represented simultaneously and on the same basis 
	as for spectral colors. Small, equally noticeable chromaticity differences 
	are represented for all chromaticities and for all kinds of variations by 
	the lengths of the radii of a family of ellipses drawn on the standard 
	chromaticity diagram. These ellipses cannot be transformed into equal-sized 
	circles by any projective transformation of the standard chromaticity 
	diagram. The consistency of these data with the results of other 
	investigators is exhibited in terms of the noticeabilities of wave-length 
	differences in the spectrum and of the noticeabilities of purity 
	differences from a neutral stimulus, as functions of dominant wave-length.},
